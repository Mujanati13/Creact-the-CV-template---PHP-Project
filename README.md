    Token-based authentication is a protocol that generates encrypted security tokens. It enables users to verify their identity to websites, which then generates a unique encrypted authentication token. That token provides users with access to protected pages and resources for a limited period of time without having to re-enter their username and password.
  Token-based authentication works through this five-step process:

<ol>
  <li>Request: The user logs in to a service using their login credentials, which issues an access request to a server or protected resource.</li>
<li>Verification: The server verifies the login information to determine that the user should have access. This involves checking the password entered against the username provided.</li>
<li>Token submission: The server generates a secure, signed authentication token for the user for a specific period of time.</li>
 <li>Storage: The token is transmitted back to the user’s browser, which stores it for access to future website visits. When the user moves on to access a new website, the authentication token is decoded and verified. If there is a match, the user will be allowed to proceed.</li>
<li>Expiration: The token will remain active until the user logs out or closes the server.</li>
</ol>
